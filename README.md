# cdm-ideintrospection-plugin
The project is a [Codimension Python IDE](http://codimension.org) introspection plugin.

With this plugin the functionality of priniting out some IDE instrospection (like
memory info) is available in the IDE.

# Installation
The plugin is pip installable:

```bash
pip install cdmideintrospectionplugin
```

There is a little value (if any) to install it without the
[Codimension IDE](http://codimension.org).

When installed a few buttons will appear on the main toolbar.
